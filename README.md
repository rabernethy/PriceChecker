# PriceChecker

## Project Description

This project was created with the goal of helping low income communities get easy access to low cost healthy food options as well as help local vendors sell their healthy products. We provide consumers the ability to add and remove items from the stock to their cart as well as have them able to add items from provided healthy recipes. Vendors have the ability to add items to the hosted database so that consumers can browse them. The app was created using JavaFX and a Flask Server connected to a SQLite database hosting our data.
